[css grid - auto-fill](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2016/04/12/flexible-sized-grids-with-auto-fill-and-minmax/)

> To achieve a truly flexible grid – flexible both in size of tracks and number – we need an additional piece of the puzzle – minmax(). 

> This would result in tracks of a minimum of 100 pixels and a maximum of 1 fraction unit of the available space. After as many 100 pixel tracks are assigned, we then have the remaining space to distribute. Our tracks are allowed to be greater than 100 pixels wide so the remaining space is equally distributed. The result as many equal width, flexible sized columns as can fit inside the container.
